This is a custom browser startpage with a simple bookmark system. It is intended to be used as a replacement for the new-tab-page provided by the browser.
  - all in one file
  - bright and dark mode based on system setting
  - bookmarks are stored in localstorage
  - bookmarks can be downloaded and uploaded for sharing between browsers and systems
  - bookmark icons are retrieved from google

### Live URL
http://kolya.schwarzsilber.de/startpage

### Usage
If you use the live url you will get automatic updates as development continues.
Or you can download the file in the repository and place it anywhere (including on the local system). You can still update it manually, simply by replacing the file.

You will probably want to use an extension to set this as your new-tab-page:

  - Firefox: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
  - Chrome: [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna)
