A custom browser startpage with a simple bookmark system. It is intended to be used as a replacement for the new-tab-page provided by the browser.

 ## Features
  - bright and dark mode based on system setting
  - mobile and desktop supported
  - runs from the local file system or server
  - no dependencies, everything in a single file for optimized caching
  - bookmarks are stored in your browser's local storage and can be backed up or imported in JSON format
  - editing or deleting of individual bookmarks
  - icons can be automatically retrieved from google or choose an icon URL or any local image file
## Live URL
https://kolya.schwarzsilber.de/startpage

## Usage
If you use the live url you will get automatic updates as development continues.
Or you can download the file index.html and place it anywhere (including your local system). You can still update it manually by replacing the file.

You may want to use a browser extension to set this file as your new-tab-page:

  - Firefox: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
  - Chrome: [blank](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blank/blomfhkjjolopkkglifoclbjmbbambpg)
  - Edge: [blank](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/blank/edoamabjjoiebpcmbkenbglenadopben)
