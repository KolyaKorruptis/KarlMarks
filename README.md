 ## Features
  - bright and dark mode based on system setting
  - mobile and desktop supported
  - runs from your local file system, your server or the live url
  - no dependencies, everything in a single HTML file for optimized caching
  - bookmarks are stored in your browser's local storage and can be backed up or imported
  - sort and edit bookmarks via drag and drop easily
  - icons can be automatically retrieved from google or choose an icon URL or pick any local image file as icon
## Live URL
https://kolya.schwarzsilber.de/startpage

## Usage
If you use the live url you will get automatic updates as development continues.
Or you can download the file index.html and place it anywhere (including your local system). You can still update it manually by replacing the file.

You may want to use a browser extension to set this file as your new-tab-page:

  - Firefox: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
  - Chrome: [blank](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blank/blomfhkjjolopkkglifoclbjmbbambpg)
  - Edge: [blank](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/blank/edoamabjjoiebpcmbkenbglenadopben)
