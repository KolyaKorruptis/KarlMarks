## Usage
If you use the live url you will get automatic updates as development continues.
Or you can download index.html and put it anywhere. You can still update it manually simply by replacing index.html.

You may want to use a browser extension to set it as your new-tab-page:

  - Firefox: [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
  - Chrome: [blank](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blank/blomfhkjjolopkkglifoclbjmbbambpg)
  - Edge: [blank](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/blank/edoamabjjoiebpcmbkenbglenadopben)
